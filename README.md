Welcome to the repository for GLCM based texture analsis of side scan sonar echograms collected with a recreational-grade system.  

#### Contents
This repostitory contains all of the data and scripts used to prepare the figures in _Coarse-resolution alluvial mappint by automated texture segmentation of recreational-grade side scan sonar imagery_ submitted to Environmental Modelling and Sofware. This repository contains a collection of files and scripts required to peform the analysis.  

#### Organization

This repository is organized as follows 

#### Dependencies
All of the scripts were developed using python 2.7.11 in a windows 10 enviroment.  I used the Anaconda distribution 4.0.0 (64 bit) with the MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64) compiler.  The following dependencies are required:


* [gdal 1.11.4](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal)
* [rasterstats](https://github.com/perrygeo/python-rasterstats)
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image)
* [joblib](https://github.com/joblib/joblib)
* [pyproj 1.9.4](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj)
